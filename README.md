Hi.

Intended for a utility for (sanity) checking which tag in git is "built on" which others.

This is probably easily doable in 2 lines of bash if you know git, but I'm a noob to git so this was my way of doing it :)

Not sure if it's even correct (see noob status above), but it's my best first attempt.
